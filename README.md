# Employee Management System Using Python
The task is to create a Database-driven Employee Management System in Python that will store the information in the MySQL Database. 
The following operations will be done in these :
* Add Employee
* Remove Employee
* Promote Employee
* Display Employees

# Tools and Techniques used:
* Programming Language : Python
* Database Management System : MySQL

# Project Features
## Add Employee Function
Add function will ask for the Employee Id and uses the check employee function to check whether the employee to be added already exist
in our record or not. If employee details do not  exist then it asks for details of the employee.

## Remove Employee Function
Remove  Function will  ask for Id of the employee to be removed because Id is Primary key in our Employee Details Record
as there can be two employees with the same name, but they must have a unique id.

## Promote Employee Function
Promote function will ask for the Employee Id and uses the check employee function to check whether the employee to be Promoted exist
in our record or not. If employee details exist then it will ask for the amount by which his salary is to be increased. 

## Display Employee Function
Display function is simply a select query of SQL which fetches all the records stored in the employee details table and prints them line by line.

## Menu Function
Menu function displays the menu to the user and asks the user to enter his choice for performing operations like Add employee, Remove employee, etc.

# Conclusion
The Employee Management System built in Python offers a robust solution for handling employee data efficiently. By leveraging MySQL for database
storage, it ensures scalability and data integrity. With features like adding, removing, and promoting employees, along with comprehensive display options, enhancing organizational effectiveness.
